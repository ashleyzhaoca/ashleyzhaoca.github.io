Halfway down, it stopped and got slower and slower. Soon, it stopped and crashed to earth with a loud beep sound. Suddenly, a robot in the UFO said, \u201cCome on board.\u201d Without any hesitation, we jumped on board because we recognized that the robot is our friend from outer space! We were so happy to see each other. After catching up, we learned that our friend, Beepy, was lonely. Beepy invited us to come aboard to explore outer space with him. We accepted his invitation excitedly! As soon as we reached outer space there was a sudden change in our form. Meow Meow became an alien, Rocky, a comet, and I, an astronaut. Upon discovering what we turned into, we were very confused! Suddenly, a strong force dragged Meow Meow, Rocky and I out of the rocket and near a huge property that was abandoned. There was a huge planet in the middle that looked like Mars and near the planet were some giant pieces of scrap metal that could be used to build a small ship. Alien, Meow Meow and Rocky both wanted the scraps. They started to fight over the property because they wanted to build a spaceship using the giant pieces of scrap metal they saw. While they were fighting, Rocky, being a comet, was smaller than Meow Meow so he fell and crashed to Earth as fast as a rocket! I saw Rocky bounce off of Earth and crashed to the sun. Luckily, he did not burn up! Meow Meow then went to the abandoned property. I boarded the UFO to explore the other planets. Soon after, I saw a rocket fly by with Meow Meow and Rocky in it. I thought that Meow Meow had used the scrap metal to build it and it looked so weird. I didn\u2019t mind how it looked because I was ready to return to Earth so I jumped on board and blasted home with them!","title":"Fiction"},{"location":"fiction/#fiction-stories","text":"","title":"Fiction Stories"},{"location":"fiction/#outer-space-adventure","text":"Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-18-2020 One day we, my cat Meow Meow, my Rocky, the raccoon, and I saw a UFO spinning and spinning up in the sky before it came down.
