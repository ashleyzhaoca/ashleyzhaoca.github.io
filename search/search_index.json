One day, I went to check on the graveyard and to my surprise, the grave was dug up. The lizard\u2019s body was nowhere to be seen. As I walked down the street, I thought, I saw a floating lizard. It didn't have a shadow and was sort of transparent, but still, you could see its stripes on its ghostly body. Later in the day, I reported the sighting to Marian, the mayor. Marian, the Mayor, gave me a strange look before walking off. About an hour after lunch, while walking on the streets, Paul was sure that he saw an odd shape forming on the sidewalk. Soon, there were rumors of ghost lizards spreading throughout Roxaboxen. Problems started occurring at the shops. At first, nobody noticed, but quickly, houses were getting vandalized. People and items were disappearing! What was going on in the quiet town of Roxaboxen? None of us had ever seen such a sight. The kids of Roxaboxen made a new plan. Eleanor, Anna May, Jamie, and Paul were now Roxaboxen\u2019s protectors. That night when the crew arrived, other shops had already been destroyed. The lizard, though, was still there. It knocked down a can of beans, which alerted the team. Because the lizard was still hovering the cans, the net that was set up captured the ghost. As soon as it got tangled in the strings of the net, it turned back into a dead lizard body. Through some sort of unexplained magic, the crew of the protectors was never seen again, except in their ghost forms. Somehow, the lizard was in its gas form before, now it is in its solid form. Through some sort of unexplained magic, the crew turned from solid to gas forms. The peaceful town of Roxaboxen became a ghost town because people had heard about the ghosts and they were too scared to come. Lime the Dragon (2): Volcano Bath Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-23-2020 Grade : G2 - G4 Remember me, I'm Lime the plant dragon. Yesterday I fell in a volcano when I was trying to fly while breathing fire. Suddenly, I fell into a volcano. Well, my luck was very, very, rotten. The volcano was extremely deep and it had no lava inside. I fell to the very, very, bottom. I had no way of getting out. Soon, my eyes had adjusted to the dim light, I saw a rope ladder that looked very new. As you might have thought, I climbed up the rope ladder, as I reached, halfway up I saw someone was pulling the rope ladder upwards while I was climbing it. As soon as I reached the top I saw a young dragon about the same age as me was pulling the rope ladder. It was my best friend Night. It turns out that he'd been practicing flying and saw me fall. So, he tried to tie some ropes together and make it a ladder for me to climb up. He lowered the ladder for me to climb up and tried to make me climb up so I could get out. Lime the Dragon (1): Field Trip of Fire Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-23-2020 Grade : G2 - G4 Roar! I'm Lime, A dragon. The breeds plant Dragon. I have a story to share about how I learned to blow fire. One day we went on a field trip to a jungle. Suddenly, a loud roar made us jump. Then I saw it was only a Ranger, but then a ghost came and tapped me on the wing. I jumped. I wanted to breath fire, but then, I remembered that I couldn't breath fire. My teacher said the ghost was a fake but I didn't believe it. We built a campfire and roasted yummy marshmallows with fish filling. Then, we went fishing in the creek. I caught four fish. In total the rest of the class caught 25 fish. We got to eat what we caught. As soon as we finished the fish, the camp fire went out. It was pitch dark. I tried to think of an idea. Then, I blew, a fire soon lit up the camp ground. The whole class clapped and cheered for me. Outer-Space Adventure Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-18-2020 One day we, my cat Meow Meow, my Rocky, the raccoon, and I saw a UFO spinning and spinning up in the sky before it came down. Halfway down, it stopped and got slower and slower. Soon, it stopped and crashed to earth with a loud beep sound. Suddenly, a robot in the UFO said, \u201cCome on board.\u201d Without any hesitation, we jumped on board because we recognized that the robot is our friend from outer space! We were so happy to see each other. After catching up, we learned that our friend, Beepy, was lonely. Beepy invited us to come aboard to explore outer space with him. We accepted his invitation excitedly! As soon as we reached outer space there was a sudden change in our form. Meow Meow became an alien, Rocky, a comet, and I, an astronaut. Upon discovering what we turned into, we were very confused! Suddenly, a strong force dragged Meow Meow, Rocky and I out of the rocket and near a huge property that was abandoned. There was a huge planet in the middle that looked like Mars and near the planet were some giant pieces of scrap metal that could be used to build a small ship. Alien, Meow Meow and Rocky both wanted the scraps. They started to fight over the property because they wanted to build a spaceship using the giant pieces of scrap metal they saw. While they were fighting, Rocky, being a comet, was smaller than Meow Meow so he fell and crashed to Earth as fast as a rocket! I saw Rocky bounce off of Earth and crashed to the sun. Luckily, he did not burn up! Meow Meow then went to the abandoned property. I boarded the UFO to explore the other planets. Soon after, I saw a rocket fly by with Meow Meow and Rocky in it. I thought that Meow Meow had used the scrap metal to build it and it looked so weird. I didn\u2019t mind how it looked because I was ready to return to Earth so I jumped on board and blasted home with them!","title":"Fiction"},{"location":"fiction/#fiction-stories","text":"","title":"Fiction Stories"},{"location":"fiction/#the-dead-lizard","text":"Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-28-2020 Grade : G2 - G4 One night during storytime, Francis told her grandchildren about the dead lizard that haunted the streets of Roxaboxen. \u201cThe dead lizard?\u201d her grandchildren asked.

I went to Regnart for second grade. It was there that I met one of my first friends, Asher. Asher is trustworthy because he will not tell a secret. He is also the founder of \"Witchip\". One day right after lunch at the lunch recess, we were playing on \"Megatoy\", a play structure. Asher found an empty Pirate Booty bag on the tanbark and filled it to the brim with \u201cWitchips\u201d, also known as tanbark. Then, he poured it on his head. \u201cThunk! Thunk! Thunk!\u201d said the \u201cWitchips\u201d as they hit the ground. That was the start of Witchip, the game. Asher also has some habits. For example, he has a bad memory. Sometimes he forgets arguments, other times he forgets meetings! Sometimes he annoys me. Other times I am glad he forgets things. At lunch we would sit on the benches and chat. The subject usually changes around, like it would go from video games to library books. At the end, it always changes to who plays with whom, or what to play or where to meet. One game we really liked to play was \u201cWarriors vs Robot Tank Things.\u201d As we pretended to chop the tanks into pieces we would shout \u201cHeyah!\u201d or \u201cXing!\u201d or an occasional \u201cOuch!\u201d. In the game, we would have a base made out of obsidian. Soon the robots would break through the base, and Asher would say something like, \u201cDid we just see some useless robots break through obsidian? Or \u201cRun for your life!!!\u201d I had many other friends but some were not as trustworthy as Asher. We have made many games like Witchip, Witchip 2, Warriors vs Robot Tank Things etc. In all of the games, I like Warriors vs Robot Tank Things the best. Even during P.E., while running laps, we would discuss new games and strategies. Here\u2019s another example of why I like Asher. On bring-a-stuffed-animal day during morning recess, I brought Meow-Meow the cat, and he brought Tiggs the bobcat. I was on the slide when I asked him to watch Meow-Meow for me. When I slid down he said, \u201cTiggs, say Hi to Meow-Meow.\u201d I thought he had an imagination as wild as a bobcat in a field of cows. In all, I think Asher is a little goofy but we\u2019re friends just the same. Ice Scream Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-23-2020 Grade : G1-G3 I scream for ice cream. Do cats like ice cream, I do. Cats like ice cream cause it's made from milk. Cats like milk. Milk is made from cows. Cats are best friends with cows. The next time you eat some ice cream, do me a favor and thank the cows for it. Oh and if you're reading this and eating ice cream, hurry up before it melts. Fires Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-22-2020 Grade : G1-G3 Some fires start by lightning! Lightning strikes a tree during a storm. The tree then burns up and the fire spreads to another tree. Sometimes, the fire spreads too quickly to put out. Each year, at least one of the fires start by matches. more than five fires start in country. There are some horrific fires started by lightning. Remember, when you smell smoke, stop, drop and roll. Make sure to safely crawl outside and then get everyone else outside. When everyone is safe, call the fire fighters. Change your smoke alarm batteries each year. Have at least two routes outside and practice fire drills every two or one month. Now, you are prepared. Amazing Lions Author : Ashley Zhao Date : unknown Cool! The lion lives in Africa and Asia. Lions love to eat zebras, wildebeast, and buffalo. Also, people are lion's main predator. There are thirteen to forty lions in a pride.

The lion's height is 7 feet or 3 meters. This animal is a carnivore. The lion's scientific name is Panthera Leo. Female lions do most of the hunting. Each pride has its own territory.

Lions live in grassy, dry, and very hot areas in Africa and Asia. They sometimes live in savariah. When lions hunt, they use the tall grass in their habitat, they hide there till one of its prey comes and the lions jump out of the grass and attach its prey. Sometimes lions rest on trees. Also, the adultmales spray stuff so the other lions won't bother them. Trees also give shade to lions. Lions hunt at night, anything that stands away from the herd is an easy target.
