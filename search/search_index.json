The scientists, VeryMad, VeryAngry and VeryExplode were triplet bulldogs. They were called V.M., V.A. and V.E.. Boom! The liquid exploded letting out puffs of smoke. \u201cPurrfect\u2026\u201d said V.E. and they burst out laughing. The very triplets headed down the hall and stopped in front of five kitten carriers. The kittens trembled helplessly in front of the giant dogs. \u201cOpen their water things!\u201d growled V.M. who appeared to be the oldest. Carefully they poured the liquid into the kittens \u201cwater things\u201d as V.M. called them. After a while, the creatures started drinking. At first, nothing happened, then BAM! BOOM! POW! MEOW! MEOW! The kittens had changed completely! Not only were they now green, but also huge. Their width was almost two feet! From nose to tail was an incredible four and a half feet long. Their height was almost unbelievable at one hundred thirty centimeters. That's the height of an eight year old kid! Anyway, Stareater, Pythonleopard, Meow-meow, Hugefatguy and Dustliker the huge Kittens trampled the building. \u201cWhy are we huge?\u201d asked Dustliker the oldest. \u201cPotion dudes.\u201d said Meowmeow pointing to the dogs who were running crazily in the lab. As the youngest, Meowmeow hated dogs. He kicked them out into the universe. \u201cHey! Hey! Hey!\u201d Python leopard tried to get the other kittens' attention, \u201cWe\u2019re floating!\u201d Indeed the planet Mreens grew smaller and smaller until it became only a dot. Being the third oldest and youngest, he often noticed things the others didn\u2019t. Jokingly Meowmeow said, \u201cLet's eat planets!\u201d It was meant to be a joke but they set off for the Milky Way. Being a cat clown he told jokes along the hard journey to the Milky Way. Once they got there they devoured the planet one by one. \u201cCrunch! Munch! Yummy!!!\u201d Those words were repeated as the monster kittens ate the planets. Soon, the Milky Way was deserted, not anything in sight. They were each billions and trillions of feet long. They then headed for Basketball Way where they found an enormous planet way bigger than any of them. It turns out Mreens and Nreens crashed to make Reave. The kittens stopped floating and shrunk to the size they had been before eating planets and after drinking the \u201cliquid.\u201d On the planet they found two wolves and a bear. The bear was Cashsurfer and the wolves were Ghostdonut and Pizzahamburger. \u201cLooks like the Verys got ya.\u201d said Ghostdonut. Stareater, the fourth oldest, nodded. \u201cTurned huge huh?\u201d asked Cashsurfer. \u201cYep.\u201d said Hugefatguy. \u201cEat this.\u201d said Pizzahamburger. He handed us some blue herb leaves. We ate. We turned back into our real selves again. \u201cThanks!\u201d we kittens said. Reave is now a home to mad scientist victims from aardvarks to zebras. Meow Meow the cat gets mad when I play with Leo, the bear. Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 07-23-2020 Grade : G1-G3 In my room, I have many stuffed animals. I call them my stuffies. Whenever I get to play with Leo, my bear, Meow Meow, my stuffie cat, gets really mad because Meow Meow is not a friend of Leo. This can be problematic at times because they are enemies. I wish that they didn\u2019t see themselves as enemies. Most of the times when it is Meow Meow\u2019s birthday, Leo is not invited and when it\u2019s Leo\u2019s birthday, Meow Meow is not invited. Well, this problem is going to get fixed and I have an idea! I will put Meow Meow at the front of the line. Wolfie, my gray stuffy in the middle of the line, and Leo at the end of the line. By separating them in line, I hope that they will get a little break from each other. I often rely on Wolfie to help me with Meow Meow and Leo so they can get along. Wolfie would bring the two friends to the rug and together, they would play \u201cBuild the Tallest Lego House\u201d game. This game helps the friends teamwork and before you know it, they will forget about not getting along! As a reward, I would bring Meow Meow and Leo to the movie theater for getting along. On our way to the theater, Kate, Leo\u2019s bear cousin and Taco, Meow Meow\u2019s fish cousin, were at the park. They saw us and wanted to know where we were going. When we told them we were going to the movies, they wanted to come too, so we invited them along. Ice Scream Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-23-2020 Grade : G1-G3 I scream for ice cream. Do cats like ice cream, I do. Cats like ice cream cause it's made from milk. Cats like milk. Milk is made from cows. Cats are best friends with cows. The next time you eat some ice cream, do me a favor and thank the cows for it. Oh and if you're reading this and eating ice cream, hurry up before it melts. (Do not feed your cat ice cream.) Lime the Dragon (2): Volcano Bath Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-23-2020 Grade : G2 - G4 Remember me, I'm Lime the plant dragon. Yesterday I fell in a volcano when I was trying to fly while breathing fire. Suddenly, I fell into a volcano. Well, my luck was very, very, rotten. The volcano was extremely deep and it had no lava inside. I fell to the very, very, bottom. I had no way of getting out. Soon, my eyes had adjusted to the dim light, I saw a rope ladder that looked very new. As you might have thought, I climbed up the rope ladder, as I reached, halfway up I saw someone was pulling the rope ladder upwards while I was climbing it. As soon as I reached the top I saw a young dragon about the same age as me was pulling the rope ladder. It was my best friend Night. It turns out that he'd been practicing flying and saw me fall. So, he tried to tie some ropes together and make it a ladder for me to climb up. He lowered the ladder for me to climb up and tried to make me climb up so I could get out. Lime the Dragon (1): Field Trip of Fire Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-23-2020 Grade : G2 - G4 Roar! I'm Lime, A dragon. The breeds plant Dragon. I have a story to share about how I learned to blow fire. One day we went on a field trip to a jungle. Suddenly, a loud roar made us jump. Then I saw it was only a Ranger, but then a ghost came and tapped me on the wing. I jumped. I wanted to breath fire, but then, I remembered that I couldn't breath fire. My teacher said the ghost was a fake but I didn't believe it. We built a campfire and roasted yummy marshmallows with fish filling. Then, we went fishing in the creek. I caught four fish. In total the rest of the class caught 25 fish. We got to eat what we caught. As soon as we finished the fish, the camp fire went out. It was pitch dark. I tried to think of an idea. Then, I blew, a fire soon lit up the camp ground. The whole class clapped and cheered for me. Outer-Space Adventure Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-18-2020 One day we, my cat Meow Meow, my Rocky, the raccoon, and I saw a UFO spinning and spinning up in the sky before it came down. Halfway down, it stopped and got slower and slower. Soon, it stopped and crashed to earth with a loud beep sound. Suddenly, a robot in the UFO said, \u201cCome on board.\u201d Without any hesitation, we jumped on board because we recognized that the robot is our friend from outer space! We were so happy to see each other. After catching up, we learned that our friend, Beepy, was lonely. Beepy invited us to come aboard to explore outer space with him. We accepted his invitation excitedly! As soon as we reached outer space there was a sudden change in our form. Meow Meow became an alien, Rocky, a comet, and I, an astronaut. Upon discovering what we turned into, we were very confused! Suddenly, a strong force dragged Meow Meow, Rocky and I out of the rocket and near a huge property that was abandoned. There was a huge planet in the middle that looked like Mars and near the planet were some giant pieces of scrap metal that could be used to build a small ship. Alien, Meow Meow and Rocky both wanted the scraps. They started to fight over the property because they wanted to build a spaceship using the giant pieces of scrap metal they saw. While they were fighting, Rocky, being a comet, was smaller than Meow Meow so he fell and crashed to Earth as fast as a rocket! I saw Rocky bounce off of Earth and crashed to the sun. Luckily, he did not burn up! Meow Meow then went to the abandoned property. I boarded the UFO to explore the other planets. Soon after, I saw a rocket fly by with Meow Meow and Rocky in it. I thought that Meow Meow had used the scrap metal to build it and it looked so weird. I didn\u2019t mind how it looked because I was ready to return to Earth so I jumped on board and blasted home with them!","title":"Fiction"},{"location":"fiction/#fiction-stories","text":"","title":"Fiction Stories"},{"location":"fiction/#huge-kittens-eat-planets","text":"Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 10-01-2020 Grade : G3 - G4 Far, far away on a planet named Mreens, three mad scientist dogs were conducting an experiment.

Female President Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 11/13/2020 Grade : G3 Think about all the presidents. Has there ever been a woman president? No. But then, why hasn\u2019t there been a woman president? I thought and researched about this question, and I have several reasons why a woman has not become president yet. First of all, long ago, women focused on housework, so they are used to it and wouldn\u2019t want to have important jobs like being a president. For example, women are too busy to be president because they have children to take care of. Second of all, people have biased opinions. Some people think that men are stronger, tougher, and smarter than women. A lot of people think men can make wiser decisions than women which can improve the country. The third reason is some people don\u2019t support the idea of a women president. Also, about a half of America\u2019s residents are children 17 years old or younger, these children might care about women being presidents, because they are too young, they cannot vote for a woman president (yet). Now, I am going to talk about how we can change and get people to vote for women to run for president. One of the most important shifts is to change peoples\u2019 beliefs. People believe that women cannot be good presidents so, to change that, we need proof that women are good leaders. The first step is to let more women have the opportunity to work outside the house and have leadership jobs. Leadership positions would allow women to have more important jobs in their domain like from being a teacher to becoming a principal, being a business woman to becoming a director, and from being a firefighter to becoming the chief firefighter. Next, we get women to run for positions as city councils, that will give her opportunities to be recognized by people so they will know her. If or when she gets elected, she can make changes. If people like the changes she made, the last step will be easy to complete. Finally, for the last step, we can have the woman who is in the city council run for president, and, if a lot of people like the changes she has made, it will be easier to get votes because the people who liked the changes might tell their friends and family to vote for her. One day\u2026 one day very soon\u2026 we will have a woman president! A Broken Car Author : Ashley Zhao Date : ??? Grade : G3 It was a sunny weekend day. My mom, my dad and I were in the front yard hanging out. Mom was about to go to the market to buy veggies when her car wouldn't start. She tried turning the key but it only sounded like this: \u201cBurrrr...chhhhh. Burrrrr. Chhhh.\u201d It was her battery problem. It had died. Dad opened the car hood to look for the battery that was a small box. He knew right away that he needed to get his car\u2019s battery charger to help recharge mom\u2019s car. He clipped the charger that was bright red onto the dead battery. Then he clipped the other end of the charger to his car\u2019s battery. By doing this, he\u2019s feeding my mom\u2019s car with \u201cjuice\u201d. While this was happening, Dad said, \u201cStay back. The electricity could hurt you!\u201d We listened and stayed back. We waited to see what would happen. I wondered, \u201cWould it work?\u201d My mom started up the engine and whoosh, it worked! Her car turned on and now it was charged. She was off! Nothing is impossible because her car problem was fixed right at home! Fires Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 08-22-2020 Grade : G1-G3 Some fires start by lightning! Lightning strikes a tree during a storm. The tree then burns up and the fire spreads to another tree. Sometimes, the fire spreads too quickly to put out. Each year, at least one of the fires start by matches. More than five fires start in country. There are some horrific fires started by lightning. Remember, when you smell smoke, stop, drop and roll. Make sure to safely crawl outside and then get everyone else outside. When everyone is safe, call the fire fighters. Change your smoke alarm batteries each year. Have at least two routes outside and practice fire drills every two or one month. Now, you are prepared. Amazing Lions Author : Ashley Zhao Date : unknown Cool! The lion lives in Africa and Asia. Lions love to eat zebras, wildebeast, and buffalo. Also, people are lion's main predator. There are thirteen to forty lions in a pride. A rumble of a lion's roar can be heard from five miles or eight kilometers away. The lion defends itself by killing or running away from predators. This big cat weighs 420 pounds. The lion's height is 7 feet or 3 meters. This animal is a carnivore. The lion's scientific name is Panthera Leo. Female lions do most of the hunting. Each pride has its own territory. Male lions leave the pride when they are two years old. In the wild, lions live 10 to 15 years. Lions rest and sleep about twenty hours a day. Lions are good swimmers. They are also good climbers. Lions live in grassy, dry, and very hot areas in Africa and Asia. They sometimes live in savariah. When lions hunt, they use the tall grass in their habitat, they hide there till one of its prey comes and the lions jump out of the grass and attach its prey. Sometimes lions rest on trees. Also, the adult males spray stuff so the other lions won't bother them. Trees also give shade to lions. Lions hunt at night, anything that stands away from the herd is an easy target. Female lions have one to six babies at a time. Lions have gold or brown-ish fur. Cheetahs, wild cats, and leopards are also big cats like lions. Lions are called the king of animals. Lions are very powerful. If its habitat is destroyed, lions will lose its home.","title":"Non-fiction"},{"location":"nonfiction/#non-fiction-stories","text":"","title":"Non-fiction Stories"},{"location":"nonfiction/#wolves","text":"Author : Ashley Zhao Date : TBD Grade : G3 Please see this link for the book.","title":"Wolves"},{"location":"nonfiction/#female-president","text":"Author : Ashley Zhao Date : 11/13/2020 Grade : G3 Think about all the presidents.

Also, the adult males spray stuff so the other lions won't bother them. Trees also give shade to lions. Lions hunt at night, anything that stands away from the herd is an easy target. Female lions have one to six babies at a time. Lions have gold or brown-ish fur. Cheetahs, wild cats, and leopards are also big cats like lions. Lions are called the king of animals.
