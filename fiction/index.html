Remember me, I'm Lime the plant dragon. Yesterday I fell in a volcano when I was trying to fly while breathing fire. Suddenly, I fell into a volcano. Well, my luck was very, 
very, rotten. The volcano was extremely deep and it had no lava inside. I fell to the very, very, bottom. I had no way of getting out. Soon, my eyes had adjusted to the dim 
light, I saw a rope ladder that looked very new.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:darkorange">
As you might have thought, I climbed up the rope ladder, as I reached, halfway up I saw someone was pulling the rope ladder upwards while I was climbing it. 
As soon as I reached the top I saw a young dragon about the same age as me was pulling the rope ladder. It was my best friend Night. It turns out that he'd been practicing flying and saw me fall. 
So, he tried to tie some ropes together and make it a ladder for me to climb up. He lowered the ladder for me to climb up and tried to make me climb up so I could get out.

Roar! I'm Lime, A dragon. The breeds plant Dragon. I have a story to share about how I learned to blow fire. 
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:purple">
One day we went on a field trip to a jungle. Suddenly, a loud roar made us jump. Then I saw it was only a Ranger, but then
a ghost came and tapped me on the wing. I jumped. I wanted to breath fire, but then, I remembered that I couldn't breath fire. My teacher said the ghost was a fake but I didn't believe it.
We built a campfire and roasted yummy marshmallows with fish filling. Then, we went fishing in the creek. I caught four fish. In total the rest of the class caught 25 fish. We got to eat what we caught. 
As soon as we finished the fish, the camp fire went out. It was pitch dark. I tried to think of an idea. Then, I blew, a fire soon lit up the camp ground. The whole class clapped and cheered for me.

<p><strong>Author</strong>: Ashley Zhao</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: 08-18-2020</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:green">
  One day we, my cat Meow Meow, my Rocky, the raccoon, and I saw a UFO spinning and spinning up in the sky before it came down. Halfway down, 
it stopped and got slower and slower. Soon, it stopped and crashed to earth with a loud beep sound.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:green">
Suddenly, a robot in the UFO said, “Come on board.”<br />
</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:green">
Without any hesitation, we jumped on board because we recognized that the robot is our friend from outer space! 
We were so happy to see each other. After catching up, we learned that our friend, Beepy, was lonely. 
Beepy invited us to come aboard to explore outer space with him. We accepted his invitation excitedly!<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:green">
As soon as we reached outer space there was a sudden change in our form. Meow Meow became an alien, Rocky, a comet, and I, an astronaut. 
Upon discovering what we turned into, we were very confused! Suddenly, a strong force dragged Meow Meow, Rocky and I out of the rocket and near a huge property that was abandoned. 
There was a huge planet in the middle that looked like Mars and near the planet were some giant pieces of scrap metal that could be used to build a small ship. 
Alien, Meow Meow and Rocky both wanted the scraps. They started to fight over the property because they wanted to build a spaceship using the giant pieces of scrap metal they saw. 
While they were fighting, Rocky, being a comet, was smaller than Meow Meow so he fell and crashed to Earth as fast as a rocket! 
I saw Rocky bounce off of Earth and crashed to the sun. Luckily, he did not burn up!
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:green">
Meow Meow then went to the abandoned property. I boarded the UFO to explore the other planets. Soon after, I saw a rocket fly by with Meow Meow and Rocky in it. 
I thought that Meow Meow had used the scrap metal to build it and it looked so weird. 
I didn’t mind how it looked because I was ready to return to Earth so I jumped on board and blasted home with them!
