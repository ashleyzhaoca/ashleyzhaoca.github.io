<p><strong>Author</strong>: Ashley Zhao</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:blue">
Far, far away on a planet named Mreens, three mad scientist dogs were conducting an experiment. The scientists, VeryMad, VeryAngry and VeryExplode were triplet bulldogs. They were called V.M., V.A. and V.E.. Boom! The liquid exploded letting out puffs of smoke. “Purrfect…” said V.E. and they burst out laughing. The very triplets headed down the hall and stopped in front of five kitten carriers. The kittens trembled helplessly in front of the giant dogs. “Open their water things!” growled V.M. who appeared to be the oldest. Carefully they poured the liquid into the kittens “water things” as V.M. called them.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:blue"> 
After a while, the creatures started drinking. At first, nothing happened, then BAM! BOOM! POW! MEOW! MEOW! The kittens had changed completely! Not only were they now green, but also huge. Their width was almost two feet! From nose to tail was an incredible four and a half feet long. Their height was almost unbelievable at one hundred thirty centimeters. That's the height of an eight year old kid!
Anyway, Stareater, Pythonleopard, Meow-meow, Hugefatguy and Dustliker the huge Kittens trampled the building. “Why are we huge?” asked Dustliker the oldest. “Potion dudes.” said Meowmeow pointing to the dogs who were running crazily in the lab. As the youngest, Meowmeow hated dogs. He kicked them out into the universe. “Hey! Hey! Hey!” Python leopard tried to get the other kittens' attention, 
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:blue"> 
“We’re floating!” Indeed the planet Mreens grew smaller and smaller until it became only a dot. Being the third oldest and youngest, he often noticed things the others didn’t.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:blue"> 
Jokingly Meowmeow said, “Let's eat planets!” It was meant to be a joke but they set off for the Milky Way. Being a cat clown he told jokes along the hard journey to the Milky Way. 
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:blue"> 
Once they got there they devoured the planet one by one. “Crunch! Munch! Yummy!!!” Those words were repeated as the monster kittens ate the planets. Soon, the Milky Way was deserted, not anything in sight. They were each billions and trillions of feet long.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:blue"> 
They then headed for Basketball Way where they found an enormous planet way bigger than any of them. It turns out Mreens and Nreens crashed to make Reave. The kittens stopped floating and shrunk to the size they had been before eating planets and after drinking the “liquid.”
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:blue"> 
On the planet they found two wolves and a bear. The bear was Cashsurfer and the wolves were Ghostdonut and Pizzahamburger. “Looks like the Verys got ya.” said Ghostdonut. Stareater, the fourth oldest, 
nodded. “Turned huge huh?” asked Cashsurfer. “Yep.” said Hugefatguy. “Eat this.” said Pizzahamburger. He handed us some blue herb leaves. We ate. We turned back into our real selves again. “Thanks!” we kittens said.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:blue"> 
Reave is now a home to mad scientist victims from aardvarks to zebras.

<p><strong>Author</strong>: Ashley Zhao</p>

<p><strong>Grade</strong>: G1-G3</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:DarkGoldenRod">
In my room, I have many stuffed animals. I call them my stuffies. Whenever I get to play with Leo, my bear, Meow Meow, my stuffie cat, gets really mad because Meow Meow is not a friend of Leo. This can be problematic at times because they are enemies. I wish that they didn’t see themselves as enemies. Most of the times when it is Meow Meow’s birthday, Leo is not invited and when it’s Leo’s birthday, Meow Meow is not invited. Well, this problem is going to get fixed and I have an idea!
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:DarkGoldenRod">
I will put Meow Meow at the front of the line. Wolfie, my gray stuffy in the middle of the line, and Leo at the end of the line. By separating them in line, I hope that they will get a little break from each other. I often rely on Wolfie to help me with Meow Meow and Leo so they can get along. Wolfie would bring the two friends to the rug and together, they would play “Build the Tallest Lego House” game. This game helps the friends teamwork and before you know it, they will forget about not getting along!
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:DarkGoldenRod">
As a reward, I would bring Meow Meow and Leo to the movie theater for getting along. On our way to the theater, Kate, Leo’s bear cousin and Taco, Meow Meow’s fish cousin, were at the park.  They saw us and wanted to know where we were going. When we told them we were going to the movies, they wanted to come too, so we invited them along.

I scream for ice cream. Do cats like ice cream, I do. Cats like ice cream cause it's made from milk. Cats like milk. Milk is made from cows. Cats are best friends with cows. The next time you eat some ice cream, do me a favor and thank
the cows for it. Oh and if you're reading this and eating ice cream, hurry up before it melts. (Do not feed your cat ice cream.)

<p><strong>Grade</strong>: G2 - G4</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:darkorange">
Remember me, I'm Lime the plant dragon. Yesterday I fell in a volcano when I was trying to fly while breathing fire. Suddenly, I fell into a volcano. Well, my luck was very, 
very, rotten. The volcano was extremely deep and it had no lava inside. I fell to the very, very, bottom. I had no way of getting out. Soon, my eyes had adjusted to the dim 
light, I saw a rope ladder that looked very new.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:darkorange">
As you might have thought, I climbed up the rope ladder, as I reached, halfway up I saw someone was pulling the rope ladder upwards while I was climbing it. 
As soon as I reached the top I saw a young dragon about the same age as me was pulling the rope ladder. It was my best friend Night. It turns out that he'd been practicing flying and saw me fall. 
So, he tried to tie some ropes together and make it a ladder for me to climb up. He lowered the ladder for me to climb up and tried to make me climb up so I could get out.

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:purple">
Roar! I'm Lime, A dragon. The breeds plant Dragon. I have a story to share about how I learned to blow fire. 
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:purple">
One day we went on a field trip to a jungle. Suddenly, a loud roar made us jump. Then I saw it was only a Ranger, but then
a ghost came and tapped me on the wing. I jumped. I wanted to breath fire, but then, I remembered that I couldn't breath fire. My teacher said the ghost was a fake but I didn't believe it.
We built a campfire and roasted yummy marshmallows with fish filling. Then, we went fishing in the creek. I caught four fish. In total the rest of the class caught 25 fish. We got to eat what we caught. 
As soon as we finished the fish, the camp fire went out. It was pitch dark. I tried to think of an idea. Then, I blew, a fire soon lit up the camp ground. The whole class clapped and cheered for me.

<p><strong>Author</strong>: Ashley Zhao</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: 08-18-2020</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:green">
  One day we, my cat Meow Meow, my Rocky, the raccoon, and I saw a UFO spinning and spinning up in the sky before it came down. Halfway down, 
it stopped and got slower and slower. Soon, it stopped and crashed to earth with a loud beep sound.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:green">
Suddenly, a robot in the UFO said, “Come on board.”<br />
</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:green">
Without any hesitation, we jumped on board because we recognized that the robot is our friend from outer space! 
We were so happy to see each other. After catching up, we learned that our friend, Beepy, was lonely. 
Beepy invited us to come aboard to explore outer space with him. We accepted his invitation excitedly!<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:green">
As soon as we reached outer space there was a sudden change in our form. Meow Meow became an alien, Rocky, a comet, and I, an astronaut. 
Upon discovering what we turned into, we were very confused! Suddenly, a strong force dragged Meow Meow, Rocky and I out of the rocket and near a huge property that was abandoned. 
There was a huge planet in the middle that looked like Mars and near the planet were some giant pieces of scrap metal that could be used to build a small ship. 
Alien, Meow Meow and Rocky both wanted the scraps. They started to fight over the property because they wanted to build a spaceship using the giant pieces of scrap metal they saw. 
While they were fighting, Rocky, being a comet, was smaller than Meow Meow so he fell and crashed to Earth as fast as a rocket! 
I saw Rocky bounce off of Earth and crashed to the sun. Luckily, he did not burn up!
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.5em; color:green">
Meow Meow then went to the abandoned property. I boarded the UFO to explore the other planets. Soon after, I saw a rocket fly by with Meow Meow and Rocky in it. 
I thought that Meow Meow had used the scrap metal to build it and it looked so weird. 
I didn’t mind how it looked because I was ready to return to Earth so I jumped on board and blasted home with them!
